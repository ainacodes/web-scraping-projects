Chobani Yogurt,53096731467, 03 9706 4707,, 453 Hammond RoadDandenong South VIC 3175,,http://www.chobani.com.au/,"Chobani was founded on the belief that people have great taste. They just need great options. That's why we started Chobani back in 2005 - to make high-quality, great tasting yogurt available to the masses. In just five short years, yogurt lovers made Chobani Greek Yogurt the #1 selling yogurt brand in America! So it was only right that we spread our wings to Australia - home to a nation of people who are passionate about food and some of the best milk in the world. How we got started While tidying up his desk back in 2005, our Founder and CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, stumbled upon a classified ad for a yogurt plant recently closed down by Kraft. After initially throwing the ad away, Hamdi listened to his gut, fished it out of the trash and went to see it that day. He decided to buy the plant on the spot, and went to work on perfecting the recipe for Chobani based on his belief that everyone, regardless of income or location, deserved access to delicious, high-quality yogurt. The first cup of CHO finally hit shelves 18 months later and has since grown to become America's #1 yogurt. What makes our yogurt special Our expert team crafts each pot of creamy Chobani so it's not only the highest quality but also tastes great! So how do we make Chobani so delicious? The secret isn't an ingredient. It's a passion and love for what we do. First, we take wholesome Australian milk and add live and active cultures. Then we strain our yogurt using an authentic process - this is the heart and soul of our craft. In fact, it takes 3 cups of milk to make 1 cup of Chobani which is why it's so deliciously thick, creamy and packed with protein. The finishing touch for our Fruit on the Bottom varieties is real fruit layered on the bottom of the pot, to make Chobani a good for you indulgence:  No preservatives. No artificial colours or flavours.  Fat-free and low-fat varieties  Two times more protein per serving than regular yogurt.  Includes 5 live & active cultures, including 3 probiotics.  Source of calcium.  Safe for those with corn, nut, and soy allergies.  Gluten-free and Kosher-Certified.  Suitable for vegetarians."

Vawdrey Australia,66 005 075 052, 03 9797 3700, 03 9702 8598, 1-53 Quantum CloseDandenong South VIC 3175,,http://www.vawdrey.com.au/,"Established in 1974 by Mick Vawdrey, Vawdrey began building truck bodies for smaller companies and owner drivers. In 1975, Russell Baker joined Mick and the two formed a strong partnership that lasted until Russell s retirement in late 2006. The 1980s saw Vawdrey grow from strength to strength, becoming a supplier to multinational companies. Vawdrey used the fallout of the 1990s 'credit crunch' as an opportunity to employ smart management techniques that would prove crucial to the company's long term success. During that period, Mick's son, Paul, was enlisted as the company's Sales Manager and the company began to manufacture semi-trailers. Vawdrey's founding pillars were built on quality, innovation and dedication, qualities that continue to drive the company until today. ""Australia challenges body builders like no other country on earth and if you take any short cuts in your building process, you'll be found wanting,"" says Paul Vawdrey. By 2001, Vawdrey moved into its current premises in Dandenong South, Victoria. The 6.5 hectare facility features a state-of-the-art manufacturing complex, spare parts, repairs, sales and administration areas. Over the next decade, Vawdrey continued its expansion, strengthening its presence in heavy-duty refrigeration markets in northern Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. In 2006, Vawdrey would unveil the Iceliner refrigerated trailer. Today, the Vawdrey name is synonymous with high quality and durability. These principles form the foundation of every trailer the company builds using the most technology and equipment available. The company's manufacturing portfolio includes B-doubles, B-triples, buckleless curtainsiders, dog trailers, drop decks, dry freights, flat tops, mezzanine deck floors, refrigerated bodies, skels, tags, tri-axle trailers and swingliners. While Vawdrey manufactures in Victoria, it has also branched out its services to accommodate a range of transport industries interstate, with to the establishment of service facilities in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. As Australia's largest independent trailer builder, Vawdrey aims to consistently improve the standard of design and quality within the country's trailer building industry."
